Now I want to be highly involved into only BitShares Core project full-time without trying to find another job for me to earn money for my family.

Currently I've researched a couple of months BitShares Core C++ project and fixed already some issues there, 
you can see my list of issues and my Pull Requests here https://github.com/cogutvalera/my-bts-issues/blob/master/README.md

I want to continuously contribute and not randomly !

Worker
------

I've created an account `valera-worker` (ID `"1.2.1037514"`). The account will be
changed to trusted community escrow multi-sig (3/4) schema with these members (subject to change so far):

- `valera-worker` (me)
- `abit`
- `xeroc`
- `fox`

I've created a worker `"Valera Cogut - Core Developer - 2018 August 1st ~ 2019 February 1st"` (ID `"1.14.xxx"`).

The worker will mainly focus on the bitshares-core repository, tasks include:

* code review
* issues fix
* bugs fix
* new features development
* documentation
* mentoring
* coordination

Duration and Pay
----------------

This proposal will last for 6 months, start from 1st August 2018 till 1st February 2019.

One-time cost reimbursement:
* Worker account lifetime fee: `694.70219 BTS`
* Worker creation fee: `xxx * 20% = yyy BTS`

This is a full time contract, 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, 160 hours per month of development.

Monthly pay:
* $12,000 per month, as 160 hours per month * $75 per hour

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by @xeroc
([link](https://github.com/xeroc/worker-proposals/blob/master/2017-02.md#worker)):

* 4.38291 BTS/bitUSD = settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writting (2018-07-19)
* 2.5 = multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow at 2.5x collateral if needed
* 12000 usd/month * 4.38291 bts/usd * 2.5 = 131,487.3  BTS/month
* 131,487.3 / 30 = 4,382.91 BTS/day

Note: I will be receiving 12,000 bitUSD per month, but not really 4,382.91 BTS per day.
The multi-sig scheme in worker account `valera-worker` will only send the correct exact
amount of funds to me. Rest of BTS will be burned back to the chain at a proper time.
